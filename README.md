# Dorchester_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for data structures

Project Description:

  For this project, I think I'm going to essentially prompt the user for how many points they want to create, create n random points with x, y values, and link them in a master linked list. From this list, I think I will create a graph with path weights equal to the distance between the points. Then, I'll implement multiple different shortest path algorithms and reorder the linked list several times in order of the shortest path found using each method. I might implement some additional criteria just to make it more interesting, because it's quite possible that all of the shortest paths will be the exact same since they are, after all, the same shortest path. From there I'll just print the output. I might implement a menu where I can create a new set of points or choose different operations to perform on the points from the menu.
